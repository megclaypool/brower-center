Add posts, pages, categories and custom post types and taxonomy terms in bulk! Managing vast amounts of content made a walk in the park!

== Description ==

Adding multiple categories in WordPress can be a real pain. When you want categories for every country in the world, it is a horrible job to fill out and submit the new category form hundreds of times, especially if you're adding terms that have a hierarchy!

BulkPress makes this process much easier, by providing you with an easy-to-user interface to add categories (and terms of custom taxonomies) and pages/posts (and posts of custom post types) in bulk, giving you the option to specify a hierarchy in the added posts or terms.

BulkPress can spare you hours of your time, just try and find out for yourself!

= More to come... =
BulkPress will be updated with new functionalities very regularly. What to think of the following features coming to your WordPress installations soon...

*	Mass add users
*	Specify attributes for the pages you're creating in bulk, such as the page template
*	Promoting multiple users to a different role in one go
*	Much, much more...
