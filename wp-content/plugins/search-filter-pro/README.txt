== Changelog ==

= 1.1.7 =
* New - *beta* - Auto count for taxonomies - when using tag, category and taxonomies only in a search form, you can now enable a live update of fields, which means as users make filter selections, unavailable combinations will be hidden (this is beta and would love feedback especially from users with high numbers of posts/taxonomies)
* New - date picker for custom fields / post meta - dates must be stored as YYYYMMDD or as timestamps in order to use this field
* New - added JS events to capture start / end of ajax loading so you can add in your own custom loaders
* Fix - prefixed taxonomy and meta field names properly - there were collisions on the set defaults function, for example if a tax and meta share the same key there would be a collision
* Fix - errors with number ranges & range slider
* Fix - an error with detecting if a meta value is serialized
* Fix - scope issue with date fields auto submitting correctly


= 1.1.6 =
* **Notice** - dropped - `.postform` css class  this was redundant and left in by error - any users using this should update their CSS to use the new and improved options provided:
* New - class names added to all field list items for easy CSS styling + added classes to all options for form inputs for easy targeting of specific field values
* New - added a `<span class="sf-count">` wrapper to all fields where a count was being shown for easy styling
* Fix - removed all reference to `__DIR__` for PHP versions < 5.3
* Fix - Some general tweaks for WPML
* Fix - a bug when choosing all post types still adding "post_types" to the url

= 1.1.5 =
* **Notice** - this update breaks previous Sort Order fields, so make sure if you have a Sort Order Field to rebuild it once you've updated!
* New - Sort Order - in addition to sorting by Meta Value, users can now sort their results by ID, author, title, name, date, date modified, parent ID, random, comment count and menu order, users can also choose whether they they want only ASC or DESC directions - both are optional.
* New - Autocomplete Comboboxes - user friendly select boxes powered by Chosen - text input with auto-complete for selects and multiple selects - just tick the box when choosing a select or multiselect input type
* Fix - add a lower priority to `init` hook when parsing taxonomies - this helps ensure S&F runs after your custom taxonomies have been created
* Fix - add a lower priority to `pre_get_posts` - helps with modifying the main query after other plugins/custom code have run
* Fix - a problem with meta values having spaces

= 1.1.4 =
* New - Meta Suggestions - auto detect values for your custom fields / post meta
