Drupal to WordPress database migration tool
by Another Cup of Coffee Limited

This tool performs the bulk of the migration from Drupal 6 to WordPress 3.5.
It works pretty well with our own installations but you will likely need
to make some tweaks, either to the code or to the migrated database. If you're
not sure how to make the appropriate changes, Another Cup of Coffee Limited
will be happy to do the work. Contact us at http://anothercoffee.net


Installation and use:
Copy folder to your web server and run the drupaltowordpress.php script on your browser. Follow the on-screen instructions.


CAUTION:
Make a backup of both your Drupal and WordPress databases before running this
tool. USE IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
