== Description ==

A handy WordPress plugin for batch creation of posts and pages in your preferred hierarchy. 
Indispensable tool for WordPress developers.

== Installation ==

1. Install Quick Bulk Post & Page Creator either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Activate the plugin.
1. That's it. You're ready to go! Please, refer to the Usage and Examples sections for examples and usage information.

== Getting Started ==
After installing and activating the plugin, go to Tools -> Quick Post Creator. Please, refer to the Usage section below for usage information and examples.

== Usage ==

When you go to Tools -> Quick Post Creator, you will find a form that allows you to bulk insert posts/pages. The form contains the following fields:

**Hierarchy Indent Character**

Specifies the character (or set of characters) that are used to specify the hierarchy indentation. You can use those characters in your Entries text, prepending one or more entries with one or more of these characters. You can read more about how this field is used in the "Entries" field description below.

**Post Type**

Specifies the post type of the entries that you want to bulk create.

**Post Status**

Specifies the post status of the entries that you want to bulk create.

**Entries**

Allows you to insert as many titles of entries as you wish. Each entry should be on a separate line. You can additionally prepend each entry with one or more hierarchy indent characters. For example, if your character is an asterisk - `*`, you can use one asterisk at the beginning of an entry to specify that it is a child of the last item without any asterisks. You can use 2 asterisks at the beginning of an entry to specify that it is a child of the last item with 1 asterisk, and so on. There is no limit of how deep you can go with your hierarchy. Also, there is no limit of the number of entries that you might want to bulk create. 

== Examples ==

**Example 1**

The following example will create 5 published posts with the corresponding titles.

* Hierarchy Indent Character: `*`
* Post Type: `Posts`
* Post Status: `Publish`
* Entries: 

`Post 1
Post 2
Post 3
Post 4
Post 5`

**Example 2**

The following example will create 5 published pages with the corresponding titles and the specified hierarchy (X1, X2 as a child of X, X1a as a child of X1 and X2, X and Y as parents).

* Hierarchy Indent Character: `-`
* Post Type: `Pages`
* Post Status: `Publish`
* Entries: 

`Page X
- Page X1
-- Page X1a
- Page X2
Page Y`
